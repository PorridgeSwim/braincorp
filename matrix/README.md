### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 (like `g++` or `clang++`).
- `make` (optional, for easier compilation using the provided Makefile).

### Files in the Project

- `main.cpp`: This is the main C++ source file that includes tests or demonstrations of the `Matrix` class functionality.
- `matrix.hpp`: The header file for the `Matrix` class.
- `matrix.cpp`: The implementation file for the `Matrix` class.
- `Makefile`: A simple build script for compiling the project.

### Compiling and running the Program
- Open a terminal.
- Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
- Run the following command:
```
make
./matrix_app
```

### Cleaning Up
- After running the tests or demonstrations, clean up the build artifacts by running:
```
make clean
```
- This command will remove the executable and any object files, ensuring a clean state for future compilations.
